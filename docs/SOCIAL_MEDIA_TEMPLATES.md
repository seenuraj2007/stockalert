### Post 1: Tip of the Day
```
💡 Inventory Management Tip:

Set your reorder point = (Average daily sales × Lead time) + Safety stock

Example:
- Sell 10 units/day
- Supplier takes 7 days
- Want 3 days safety stock
- Reorder point = (10 × 7) + (10 × 3) = 100 units

With DKS StockAlert, set this once and get automatic WhatsApp alerts! 📱
